## Lessons Learned:

I learned to be extremely patient. I thought I had lost all my work - turns out if was oddly hiding in a different location on my laptop. I will be pushing to git much much early with any changes - definitely a lesson learned. 

I enjoyed figuring out how to make this a stronger App. While it took me a little longer I really like how it turned out. Figuring out how to allow users to edit took some googling, but I'm happy this functions like a CRUD app.
